As a frequent user of the YNAB app, I found it frustrating that transactions from the Apple card cannot be imported directly from the bank or card holder.  I would have to look at the app and enter them manually until the very end of the month
when the statement was ready to download.  This program takes input as a txt file.  This text file can by generated by taking a screen shot of the apple transactions page in the wallet app, converting the text part using an OCR scanner, and then running it through this program to generate a csv file to then import into YNAB.  An example text file would look something like this:

This program will take the above input and output a CSV file which can then be imported into YNAB for easy transaction handling.
